# Code of Conduct

## Introduction

As contributors and maintainers of this project, we are committed to fostering an open and inclusive community. We value the participation of every individual and want to ensure a welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our project, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all contributors to help us create a safe and positive experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibilities of Participants

Community members are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Community members are encouraged to report any behavior they find inappropriate by contacting the project team at jorge.echavarria[at]lrz.de.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing the project or community include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of the project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
